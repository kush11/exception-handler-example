# React Native Exception handler example

**This is an example repo**
This repo contains a basic react native app boilerplate code.

I have integrated both JS Exception handler and Native exception handler here to showcase how to integrate the library.

**The details of how the libarary works and integration can be found here:**

[https://github.com/master-atul/react-native-exception-handler](https://github.com/master-atul/react-native-exception-handler)


To run the app:
1. `git clone https://github.com/master-atul/react-native-exception-handler-example`
2. `yarn install`
3. `react-native run-ios --configuration Release` or `react-native run-android --variant=release`

JS Exceptions can be caught even when running in development mode, Since I have enabled Catching JS Exceptions during development. So for JS exceptions you can run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`.

Hence if you click on **Cause JS Exception** Button, you should see the error been caught straight away.

In case of native exceptions . You would need to run the app in the bundled mode using:

`react-native run-ios --configuration Release`

For Android you can run it using: 

`react-native run-android --variant=release`

This runs the app on simulator in release configuration.
